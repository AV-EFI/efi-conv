# efi-conv

Reference repository for creating mappings to the [AVefi schema][]. If
you consider contributing data to the [AVefi project][], that is,
registering persistent identifiers for some audio-visual material in
your collection, this may be a good place to start. Contributions are
very welcome. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests or otherwise
get in touch and let us jointly work on your mapping.

[AVefi project]: https://projects.tib.eu/av-efi/
[AVefi schema]: https://av-efi.github.io/av-efi-schema/

## Usage example

The check module included in this package allows you to validate
generated JSON files that are supposed to comply with the
[AVefi schema][]. Simply clone the repository and either use
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or install the
package in a virtual environment in editable mode. The latter can be
done in the traditional way using pip but it is highly recommended to
use the dependency manager [UV][uv_install] instead, especially if you
consider contributing and might need to add dependencies at some
point.

For seasoned Docker users, here is how to run the checks against your
data just a few simple steps:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/AV-EFI/efi-conv.git
## [...]
$ cd efi-conv
$ docker-compose pull
## If that does not work run:
## $ docker-compose build
## Then:
$ docker-compose run efi-conv check tests/avportal/efi_records.json
INFO efi_conv.core.check: Processing tests/avportal/efi_records.json
INFO efi_conv.core.check: All 3 records passed the checks successfully
```

Everyone else should rather setup a dedicated virtual environment,
preferably using the [dependency manager UV][uv_install].

Here is a more complete usage example showing how to convert some test
data:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/AV-EFI/efi-conv.git
## [...]
$ cd efi-conv
$ uv sync --no-python-downloads
## [...]
$ uv run efi-conv --help
Usage: efi-conv [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
  check  Sanity check EFI_FILES and optionally remove invalid records.
  from   Convert files from some schema into a JSON file with AVefi records.
$ uv run efi-conv from --help
Usage: efi-conv from [OPTIONS] [INPUT_FILES]...

  Convert files from some schema into a JSON file with AVefi records.

Options:
  -f, --format [avportal|fmdu]  Source data format.  [required]
  -o, --output FILE             Output file (stdout if not specified).
  --help                        Show this message and exit.
$ uv run efi-conv from -f avportal -o efi_records.json tests/avportal/*.xml
INFO efi_conv.avportal.avportal: Replaced name 'Dore Kleindienst-Andrée' by 'Kleindienst-Andrée, Dore'
INFO efi_conv.avportal.avportal: Replaced name 'E. Fischer' by 'Fischer, E.'
$ uv run efi-conv check tests/avportal/efi_records.json
INFO efi_conv.core.check: Processing tests/avportal/efi_records.json
INFO efi_conv.core.check: All 3 records passed the checks successfully
```

Alternatively, use the provided docker-compose file in order to run
this tool inside a container:

## Developer note

If you consider hacking on this package and even making a pullrequest
at some point, it is advisable to install the pre-commit hooks
configured on this repository. This way, some quality checks and
coding style guide lines will be enforced right from the beginning
which will make merging your code much easier, eventually. The
pre-commit package is not part of the package's virtual environment
and needs to be installed globally instead. This is because the hooks
are executed automatically on every `git commit`; the hooks themselves
are configured for this repository only, of course. So, here is one
way to set things up:

```console
$ pipx install pre-commit
$ pre-commit install
```

That's all. Feel free to start hacking!

Add new converters as modules within the [efi_conv
package](./src/efi_conv). Then, add this module as another choice to
the `IMPORTERS` list in [cli.py](./src/efi_conv/core/cli.py) to make it
accessible from the command line. Take care that the module provides
`.module_name:efi_import` function similar to what the avportal module
does.

Unless you already have a suitable python parser for your data, check
out whether the [xsData][xsdata] or similar projects can help you
there. In fact, the [avportal module relies on xsData for
parsing](./src/efi_conv/avportal/README.md) as has been briefly
documented.

The actual mapping is the tedious part. See
[avportal.py](./src/efi_conv/avportal/avportal.py) for the kind of
work you are letting yourself in for. Also consult the [AVefi schema
documentation][AVefi schema].
